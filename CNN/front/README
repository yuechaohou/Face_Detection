Training Procedure
1. Use test3.sh to choose some positive and negative samples as test samples, and move them to a new directory
2. Use try.py to print positive training samples list in tmp_pos.txt and negative training samples list in tmp_neg.txt
3. Based on batch size 100 and ratio between positive and negative training sample number, choose the best ratio between positive training sample and negative training sample.
4. Use create_list.cpp to create training samples list.
5. Use create_lmdb.sh to transform training sample to lmdb form
6. Use create_meanfile.sh to create meanfile
7. Change parameters in mult_solver.prototxt 
8. Change directory of training and testing samples in face_train.prototxt, face_test.prototxt
9. Run python ~/caffe/python/train_face.py to train model and plot figure.

Testing Procedure
1. Use ~/caffe/python/convert_mean.py to convert face_mean.binaryproto to face_mean.npy
2. face_deploy.prototxt for testing batch size 1 
3. face_deploy2.prototxt for testing batch size <=500 (parallel computation of GPU)
4. run python ~/caffe/python/test_pl_front.py to test figure (see pipeline folder for test files)
